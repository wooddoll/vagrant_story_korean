MAP001,2,3,27,"«FB28»«FA24»Put out the fires,↵«FA24»or weʹll lose the manor↵«FA24»and all will be for naught!"
MAP001,3,3,34,"«FB30»«FA0C»Split the knights into two groups,↵«FA0C»one to douse the blaze, the other↵«FA0C»to exterminate the traitors!"

MAP003,1,2,23,«FBB0»«FA12»Torch the chambers↵«FA02»and kill the hostages!!
MAP003,2,1,4,«FB60»«FB04»Aye!
MAP004,0,2,19,«FB60» ...Well?↵ Have you found it?
MAP004,1,1,13,«FB98»«FB04» Itʹs no use.
MAP004,2,3,16,«FB30»«FA0C»Thereʹs nothing↵«FA0C»like that here--↵«FA0C»anywhere.

MAP005,0,2,22,«FB30»«FA0C»Curse the duke!↵«FA0C»Whereʹs he hidden it!?
MAP005,1,2,17,«FB60»«FA1E»You sure the duke↵«FA1E»really has it?
MAP005,2,2,21,«FB60»«FA12»Does the damned thing↵«FA12»even exist?
MAP005,3,1,21,"«FBB8»«FA0C»You doubt me, Hardin?"

MAP013,5,1,19,«FB60»«FA12»Buggered if I know!
MAP013,6,2,22,«FB30»«FA0C»Look«FA02»--weʹll be cut off↵«FA0C»from the others!

MAP014,3,3,26,«FB30» ...Anʹ a wyrm«FA02»--a DRAGON«FA02»--↵ was sighted at the dukeʹs↵ manor.
MAP014,4,2,30,"«FB60»«FA0C»Well, if thereʹs magick about,↵«FA0C»dragons wonʹt be far behind..."
MAP014,5,2,26,«FB68»«FA18»I worry about Guildenstern↵«FA18»and the others.
MAP014,6,1,24,"«FB90»«FA24»...Ach, theyʹll be fine."
MAP014,7,1,12,«FB90»«FA48»Think of it!
MAP014,8,3,34,"«FB28»«FA02»«FA0C»If weʹve witnessed miracles↵«FA02»«FA0C»such as these on Leá Mondeʹs↵«FA01» doorstep, what then lies within!?"

MAP014,13,3,34,"«FB30»«FA12»ʹTis just a rumor, but Iʹve heard↵«FA12»that Guildensternʹs lot works them↵«FA12»magicks as well..."
MAP014,14,2,27,«FB60»«FA0C»Rubbish!↵«FA0C»Weʹre servants of the Lord!
MAP014,15,3,27,«FB30»«FA0C»No true Knight of the Cross↵«FA0C»would dabble in the black↵«FA0C»arts!

MAP014,24,4,29,"«FB28»«FA0C»Aye, but with a Grimoire,↵«FA0C»your fattest sow could outfly↵«FA0C»my swiftest falcon«FA02»--if ye↵«FA0C»believe the chroniclers."
MAP014,25,2,16,"«FB60»«FA12»With a Grimoire,↵«FA12»you say?"
MAP014,26,3,18,«FB30»«FA0C»Ye could even make↵«FA0C»cobblestones float↵«FA0C»like clouds...

MAP017,1,2,16,«FB68» Parliamentʹs...↵ watchdogs?
MAP017,2,1,20,«FB90»«FA12»An agent of the VKP.
MAP017,3,3,22,"«FB30»«FA12»You can follow orders,↵«FA12»can you not?↵«FA12»The VKP is your enemy."
MAP017,4,1,8,"«FB60»«FA0C»Now, go!"

MAP023,0,1,15,«FB60»«FA0C»...Whatʹs this?
MAP023,1,2,21,«FB60» Thatʹs what Iʹm here↵ to find out.
MAP023,2,3,17,«FB30»«FA12»It does seem well↵«FA12»fortified for a↵«FA12»wine cellar...
MAP023,3,2,32,«FB60» Oh? Leá Mondeʹs wineries once↵ vied with the best of Valendia.
MAP023,4,3,29,"«FB28» Since they went out of↵ production, the remaining↵ vintages sell for a premium."
MAP023,5,2,20,"«FB60»«FA0C»...If I find any,↵«FA0C»consider them yours."
MAP023,6,1,21,«FB80»«FA0C»You plan to go alone?
MAP023,7,3,24,«FB30»«FA0C»An agent with no combat↵«FA0C»experience would just be↵«FA0C»a liability.
MAP023,8,1,9,«FB48»«FA18».........
MAP023,9,3,27,«FB30»«FA12»Tell me what you know about↵«FA12»Müllenkamp and this Sydney↵«FA12»fellow.
MAP023,10,3,28,«FB30»«FA18»...Sydney Losstarot.↵«FA18»Leader of the religious cult↵«FA18»Müllenkamp.
MAP023,11,3,32,«FB28»«FA0C»His real name and age are↵«FA0C»unknown. One of many self—styled↵«FA0C»prophets of the apocalypse.«FC32»
MAP023,12,3,20,«FB30» So why would a cult↵ missionary commit↵«FA0C»such a crime?
MAP023,13,3,34,"«FB30»«FA0C»I do not know what the cardinal↵«FA0C»thinks, but the VKP believes he is↵«FA0C»no prophet«FA02»--"
MAP023,14,3,34,"«FB30»«FA0C»Indeed, he is in dark alliance↵«FA0C»with Duke Bardorba, who controls↵«FA0C»Parliament from behind the scenes."
MAP023,15,1,29,«FB88»«FA1E»That the cult is but a front.
MAP023,16,3,31,«FB30»«FA12»Perhaps this incident is a sign↵«FA12»of some falling—out between↵«FA12»the two?
MAP023,17,3,20,«FB30»«FA0C»...Or merely another↵«FA0C»of the cardinalʹs↵«FA0C»witch—hunts?
MAP029,0,1,26,«F800»«FB20»A door opened somewhere...

MAP062,0,3,28,"«FB28»«FA02» ...So, the knights who came↵«FA02» were not the kingʹs men,↵«FA02» but the cardinalʹs?"
MAP062,1,3,20,"«FB30»«FA0C»Knights of the Cross↵«FA0C»led by Guildenstern,↵«FA0C»my lord."
MAP062,2,3,23,«FB30»«FA02» ʺThe Crimson Bladesʺ«FA02»--↵«FA0C»in direct service↵«FA12»to the cardinal.
MAP062,3,3,27,«FB88»«FA18»Guildenstern led his men↵«FA18»toward Leá Monde in pursuit↵«FA18»of Sydney.
MAP062,4,1,9,«FB60»«FA0C»...I see.
MAP062,5,3,32,«FB30»«FA0C»...Send one of your men in the↵«FA0C»armor of these ʺholy knightsʺ...↵«FA0C»Set fire to the manor.

MAP062,7,2,20,«FB60»«FA12»The fool Sydney used↵«FA12»his wyvern.

MAP062,11,2,11,«FB28»«FA0C»...What of↵«FA0C»Parliament?
MAP062,12,3,32,«FB30»«FA0C»The VKP (Valendia Knights of the↵«FA0C»Peace) have formed a squad to↵«FA0C»deal with the felons.

MAP062,14,1,19,"«FB60»«FA0C»Your will, my lord?"

MAP062,17,1,15,«FB60»«FA12»And Parliament?
MAP062,18,2,34,«FB60» Iʹll deal with those watchdogs...↵ They wonʹt trouble you further.
MAP062,19,1,26,«FB60»«FA0C»And the young Lord Joshua?

MAP103,4,3,31,«FB28»«FA0C»...It was during my days in↵«FA0C»the Peaceguard. There was an↵«FA0C»investigation into an incident.
MAP103,5,3,35,"«FB28»«FA0C»I was part of a special team,↵«FA0C»entrusted with delivering blades↵«FA0C»to rebels in a neighboring kingdom."
